                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION<br>
                <br>
                1. Definitions.<br>
                <br>
                "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,<br>
                and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.<br>
                <br>
                "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by<br>
                the copyright owner that is granting the License.<br>

                other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br>
                control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
                "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
                direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
                otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>
                outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.<br>
                <br>
                "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity<br>
                exercising permissions granted by this License.<br>

                including but not limited to software source code, documentation<br>
                source, and configuration files.<br>
                <br>
                "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical<br>
                transformation or translation of a Source form, including but<br>
                not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,<br>
                and conversions to other media types.<br>
                <br>
                "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
                Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
                copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
                (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
                <br>
                "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
                form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
                editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
                represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
                of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
                separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
                the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
                <br>
                "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
                the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
                to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
                submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
                or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
                the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
                means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
                to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
                communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
                and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
                Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
                excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
                designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
                <br>
                "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>
                on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and<br>
                subsequently incorporated within the Work.<br>
                <br>
                2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
                publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
                Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
                <br>
                3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
                use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
                where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
                as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
                <br>
                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
                meet the following conditions:<br>
                <br>
                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
                <br>
                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
                stating that You changed the files; and<br>
                <br>
                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
                the Derivative Works; and<br>
                <br>
                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                as modifying the License.<br>
                <br>
                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                the conditions stated in this License.<br>
                <br>
                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
                <br>
                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
                <br>
                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
                <br>
                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
                <br>
                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
                <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br>

            <p>                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
                <br>
                Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
                Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
                of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
                <br>
                Preamble<br>
                <br>
                The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
                software and other kinds of works.<br>
                <br>
                The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
                to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
                the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
                share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
                software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
                GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
                any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
                your programs, too.<br>
                <br>
                When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
                them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
                want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
                free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
                <br>
                To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
                these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
                certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
                you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
                <br>
                For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
                gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
                freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
                or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
                know their rights.<br>
                <br>
                Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
                (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
                giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
                <br>
                For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
                that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
                authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
                changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
                authors of previous versions.<br>
                <br>
                Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
                modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
                can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
                protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
                pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
                use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
                have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
                products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
                stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
                of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
                States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
                software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
                avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
                make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
                patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
                <br>
                The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
                modification follow.<br>
                <br>
                TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                0. Definitions.<br>
                <br>
                "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
                <br>
                "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
                works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
                <br>
                "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
                License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
                "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
                <br>
                To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
                in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
                exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
                earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
                <br>
                A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
                on the Program.<br>
                <br>
                To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
                permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
                infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
                computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
                distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
                public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
                <br>
                To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
                parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
                a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
                <br>
                An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
                to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
                feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
                tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
                extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
                work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
                the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
                menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
                <br>
                1. Source Code.<br>
                <br>
                The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
                for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
                form of a work.<br>
                <br>
                A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
                standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
                interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
                is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
                <br>
                The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
                than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
                packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
                Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
                implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
                "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
                (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
                (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
                produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
                <br>
                The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
                the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
                work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
                control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
                System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
                programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
                which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
                includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
                the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
                linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
                such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
                subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
                <br>
                The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
                can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
                Source.<br>
                <br>
                The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
                same work.<br>
                <br>
                2. Basic Permissions.<br>
                <br>
                All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
                copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
                conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
                permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
                covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
                content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
                rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
                <br>
                You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
                convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
                in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
                of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
                with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
                the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
                not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
                for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
                and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
                your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
                <br>
                Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
                the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
                makes it unnecessary.<br>
                <br>
                3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
                <br>
                No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
                measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
                11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
                similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
                measures.<br>
                <br>
                When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
                circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
                is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
                the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
                modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
                users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
                technological measures.<br>
                <br>
                4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
                <br>
                You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
                receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
                keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
                non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
                keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
                recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
                <br>
                You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
                and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
                <br>
                5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
                <br>
                You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
                produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
                terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
                <br>
                a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
                it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
                <br>
                b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
                released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
                7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
                "keep intact all notices".<br>
                <br>
                c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
                License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
                License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
                additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
                regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
                permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
                invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
                <br>
                d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
                Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
                interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
                work need not make them do so.<br>
                <br>
                A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
                works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
                and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
                in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
                "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
                used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
                beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
                in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
                parts of the aggregate.<br>
                <br>
                6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
                <br>
                You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
                of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
                machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
                in one of these ways:<br>
                <br>
                a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
                (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
                Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
                customarily used for software interchange.<br>
                <br>
                b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
                (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
                written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
                long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
                model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
                copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
                product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
                medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
                more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
                conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
                Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
                <br>
                c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
                written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
                alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
                only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
                with subsection 6b.<br>
                <br>
                d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
                place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
                Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
                further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
                Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
                copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
                may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
                that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
                clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
                Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
                Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
                available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
                <br>
                e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
                you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
                Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
                charge under subsection 6d.<br>
                <br>
                A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
                from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
                included in conveying the object code work.<br>
                <br>
                A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
                tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
                or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
                into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
                doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
                product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
                typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
                of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
                actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
                is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
                commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
                the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
                <br>
                "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
                procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
                and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
                a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
                suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
                code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
                modification has been made.<br>
                <br>
                If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
                specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
                part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
                User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
                fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
                Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
                by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
                if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
                modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
                been installed in ROM).<br>
                <br>
                The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
                requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
                for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
                the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
                network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
                adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
                protocols for communication across the network.<br>
                <br>
                Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
                in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
                documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
                source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
                unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
                <br>
                7. Additional Terms.<br>
                <br>
                "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
                License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
                Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
                be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
                that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
                apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
                under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
                this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
                <br>
                When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
                remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
                it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
                removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
                additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
                for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
                <br>
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
                add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
                that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
                <br>
                a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
                terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
                <br>
                b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
                author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
                Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
                <br>
                c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
                requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
                reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
                <br>
                d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
                authors of the material; or<br>
                <br>
                e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
                trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
                <br>
                f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
                material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
                it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
                any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
                those licensors and authors.<br>
                <br>
                All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
                restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
                received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
                governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
                restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
                a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
                License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
                of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
                not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
                <br>
                If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
                must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
                additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
                where to find the applicable terms.<br>
                <br>
                Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
                form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
                the above requirements apply either way.<br>
                <br>
                8. Termination.<br>
                <br>
                You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
                provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
                modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
                this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
                paragraph of section 11).<br>
                <br>
                However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
                license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
                provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
                finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
                holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
                prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
                <br>
                Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
                reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
                violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
                received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
                copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
                your receipt of the notice.<br>
                <br>
                Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
                licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
                this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
                reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
                material under section 10.<br>
                <br>
                9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
                <br>
                You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
                run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
                occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
                to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
                nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
                modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
                not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
                covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
                <br>
                10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
                <br>
                Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
                receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
                propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
                for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
                <br>
                An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
                organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
                organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
                work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
                transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
                licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
                give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
                Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
                the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
                <br>
                You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
                rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
                not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
                rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
                any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
                sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
                <br>
                11. Patents.<br>
                <br>
                A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
                License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
                work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
                <br>
                A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
                owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
                hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
                by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
                but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
                consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
                purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
                patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
                this License.<br>
                <br>
                Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
                patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
                make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
                propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
                <br>
                In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
                agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
                (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
                sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
                party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
                patent against the party.<br>
                <br>
                If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
                and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
                to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
                publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
                then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
                available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
                patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
                consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
                license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
                actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
                covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
                in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
                country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
                <br>
                If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
                arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
                covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
                receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
                or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
                you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
                work and works based on it.<br>
                <br>
                A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
                the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
                conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
                specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
                work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
                in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
                to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
                the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
                parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
                patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
                conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
                for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
                contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
                or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
                <br>
                Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
                any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
                otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
                <br>
                12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
                <br>
                If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
                covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
                not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
                to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
                the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
                License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
                <br>
                13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
                <br>
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
                permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
                under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
                combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
                License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
                but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
                section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
                combination as such.<br>
                <br>
                14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
                <br>
                The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
                the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
                address new problems or concerns.<br>
                <br>
                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
                Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
                Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
                option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
                version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
                Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
                GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
                by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
                <br>
                If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
                versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
                public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
                to choose that version for the Program.<br>
                <br>
                Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
                permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
                author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
                later version.<br>
                <br>
                15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
                <br>
                THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
                APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
                HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
                THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
                PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
                IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
                ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
                <br>
                16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
                <br>
                IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
                THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
                GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
                USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
                DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
                PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
                EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
                SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
                <br>
                17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
                <br>
                If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
                above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
                reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
                an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
                Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
                copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
                <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
                <br>
                If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
                possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
                free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
                <br>
                To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
                to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
                state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
                the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
                <br>
                &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>

                <br>
                This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
                but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>

                You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
                along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
                <br>
                Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
                <br>
                If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
                notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
                <br>

                This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
                This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
                under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
                <br>
                The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
                parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
                might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
                <br>
                You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
                if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>

                The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
                into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
                may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
                the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>

                other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common<br>
                control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
                "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
                direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
                otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>

                <br>
                "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
                Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
                copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
                (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
                <br>
                "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
                form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
                editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
                represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
                of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
                separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
                the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
                <br>
                "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
                the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>

                designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
                <br>
                "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>

                <br>
                2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
                publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
                Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
                <br>
                3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
                use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
                where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
                as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
                <br>
                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
                meet the following conditions:<br>
                <br>
                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
                <br>
                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
                stating that You changed the files; and<br>
                <br>
                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
                the Derivative Works; and<br>
                <br>
                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                as modifying the License.<br>
                <br>
                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                the conditions stated in this License.<br>
                <br>
                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
                <br>
                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
                <br>
                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
                <br>
                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
                <br>
                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
                <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.<br>
                <br>
                To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following<br>
                boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"<br>

                GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
                Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
                <br>
                Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;<br>
                Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
                of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
                <br>
                Preamble<br>
                <br>
                The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
                software and other kinds of works.<br>
                <br>
                The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
                to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
                the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
                share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
                software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
                GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
                any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
                your programs, too.<br>
                <br>
                When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
                price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
                have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
                them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
                want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
                free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
                <br>
                To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
                these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
                certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
                you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
                <br>
                For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
                gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
                freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
                or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
                know their rights.<br>
                <br>
                Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
                (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
                giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
                <br>
                For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
                that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
                authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
                changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
                authors of previous versions.<br>
                <br>
                Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
                modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
                can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
                protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
                pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
                use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
                have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
                products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
                stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
                of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
                States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
                software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
                avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
                make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
                patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
                <br>
                The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
                modification follow.<br>
                <br>
                TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                0. Definitions.<br>
                <br>
                "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
                <br>
                "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
                works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
                <br>
                "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
                License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
                "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
                <br>
                To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
                in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
                exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
                earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
                <br>
                A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
                on the Program.<br>
                <br>
                To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
                permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
                infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
                computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
                distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
                public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
                <br>
                To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
                parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
                a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
                <br>
                An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
                to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
                feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
                tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
                extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
                work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
                the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
                menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
                <br>
                1. Source Code.<br>
                <br>
                The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
                for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
                form of a work.<br>
                <br>
                A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
                standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
                interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
                is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
                <br>
                The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
                than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
                packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
                Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
                Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
                implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
                "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
                (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
                (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
                produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
                <br>
                The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
                the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
                work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
                control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
                System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
                programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
                which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
                includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
                the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
                linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
                such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
                subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
                <br>
                The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
                can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
                Source.<br>
                <br>
                The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
                same work.<br>
                <br>
                2. Basic Permissions.<br>
                <br>
                All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
                copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
                conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
                permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
                covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
                content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
                rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
                <br>
                You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
                convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
                in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
                of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
                with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
                the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
                not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
                for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
                and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
                your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
                <br>
                Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
                the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
                makes it unnecessary.<br>
                <br>
                3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
                <br>
                No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
                measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
                11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
                similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
                measures.<br>
                <br>
                When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
                circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
                is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
                the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
                modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
                users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
                technological measures.<br>
                <br>
                4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
                <br>
                You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
                receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
                keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
                non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
                keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
                recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
                <br>
                You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
                and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
                <br>
                5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
                <br>
                You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
                produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
                terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
                <br>
                a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
                it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
                <br>
                b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
                released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
                7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
                "keep intact all notices".<br>
                <br>
                c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
                License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
                License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
                additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
                regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
                permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
                invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
                <br>
                d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
                Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
                interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
                work need not make them do so.<br>
                <br>
                A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
                works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
                and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
                in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
                "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
                used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
                beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
                in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
                parts of the aggregate.<br>
                <br>
                6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
                <br>
                You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
                of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
                machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
                in one of these ways:<br>
                <br>
                a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
                (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
                Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
                customarily used for software interchange.<br>
                <br>
                b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
                (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
                written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
                long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
                model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
                copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
                product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
                medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
                more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
                conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
                Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
                <br>
                c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
                written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
                alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
                only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
                with subsection 6b.<br>
                <br>
                d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
                place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
                Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
                further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
                Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
                copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
                may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
                that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
                clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
                Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
                Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
                available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
                <br>
                e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
                you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
                Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
                charge under subsection 6d.<br>
                <br>
                A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
                from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
                included in conveying the object code work.<br>
                <br>
                A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
                tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
                or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
                into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
                doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
                product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
                typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
                of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
                actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
                is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
                commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
                the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
                <br>
                "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
                procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
                and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
                a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
                suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
                code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
                modification has been made.<br>
                <br>
                If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
                specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
                part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
                User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
                fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
                Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
                by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
                if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
                modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
                been installed in ROM).<br>
                <br>
                The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
                requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
                for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
                the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
                network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
                adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
                protocols for communication across the network.<br>
                <br>
                Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
                in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
                documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
                source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
                unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
                <br>
                7. Additional Terms.<br>
                <br>
                "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
                License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
                Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
                be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
                that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
                apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
                under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
                this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
                <br>
                When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
                remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
                it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
                removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
                additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
                for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
                <br>
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
                add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
                that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
                <br>
                a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
                terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
                <br>
                b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
                author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
                Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
                <br>
                c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
                requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
                reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
                <br>
                d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
                authors of the material; or<br>
                <br>
                e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
                trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
                <br>
                f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
                material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
                it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
                any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
                those licensors and authors.<br>
                <br>
                All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
                restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
                received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
                governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
                restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
                a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
                License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
                of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
                not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
                <br>
                If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
                must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
                additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
                where to find the applicable terms.<br>
                <br>
                Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
                form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
                the above requirements apply either way.<br>
                <br>
                8. Termination.<br>
                <br>
                You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
                provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
                modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
                this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
                paragraph of section 11).<br>
                <br>
                However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
                license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
                provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
                finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
                holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
                prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
                <br>
                Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
                reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
                violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
                received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
                copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
                your receipt of the notice.<br>
                <br>
                Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
                licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
                this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
                reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
                material under section 10.<br>
                <br>
                9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
                <br>
                You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
                run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
                occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
                to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
                nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
                modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
                not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
                covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
                <br>
                10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
                <br>
                Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
                receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
                propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
                for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
                <br>
                An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
                organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
                organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
                work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
                transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
                licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
                give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
                Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
                the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
                <br>
                You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
                rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
                not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
                rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
                (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
                any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
                sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
                <br>
                11. Patents.<br>
                <br>
                A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
                License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
                work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
                <br>
                A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
                owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
                hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
                by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
                but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
                consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
                purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
                patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
                this License.<br>
                <br>
                Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
                patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
                make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
                propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
                <br>
                In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
                agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
                (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
                sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
                party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
                patent against the party.<br>
                <br>
                If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
                and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
                to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
                publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
                then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
                available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
                patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
                consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
                license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
                actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
                covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
                in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
                country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
                <br>
                If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
                arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
                covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
                receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
                or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
                you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
                work and works based on it.<br>
                <br>
                A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
                the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
                conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
                specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
                work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
                in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
                to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
                the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
                parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
                patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
                conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
                for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
                contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
                or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
                <br>
                Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
                any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
                otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
                <br>
                12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
                <br>
                If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
                otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
                excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
                covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
                License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
                not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
                to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
                the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
                License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
                <br>
                13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
                <br>
                Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
                permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
                under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
                combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
                License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
                but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
                section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
                combination as such.<br>
                <br>
                14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
                <br>
                The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
                the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
                be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
                address new problems or concerns.<br>
                <br>
                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
                Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
                Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
                option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
                version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
                Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
                GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
                by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
                <br>
                If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
                versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
                public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
                to choose that version for the Program.<br>
                <br>
                Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
                permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
                author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
                later version.<br>
                <br>
                15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
                <br>
                THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
                APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
                HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
                OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
                THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
                PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
                IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
                ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
                <br>
                16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
                <br>
                IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
                WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
                THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
                GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
                USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
                DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
                PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
                EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
                SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
                <br>
                17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
                <br>
                If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
                above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
                reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
                an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
                Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
                copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
                <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
                <br>
                If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest<br>
                possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it<br>
                free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
                <br>
                To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest<br>
                to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively<br>
                state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least<br>
                the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
                <br>
                &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;<br>
                Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
                <br>
                This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify<br>
                it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by<br>
                the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or<br>
                (at your option) any later version.<br>
                <br>
                This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,<br>
                but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of<br>
                MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the<br>
                GNU General Public License for more details.<br>
                <br>
                You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License<br>
                along with this program.  If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.<br>
                <br>
                Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
                <br>
                If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short<br>
                notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:<br>
                <br>
                &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;<br>
                This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.<br>
                This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it<br>
                under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.<br>
                <br>
                The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate<br>
                parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands<br>
                might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an "about box".<br>
                <br>
                You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,<br>
                if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.<br>
                For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see<br>

                <br>
                The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program<br>
                into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you<br>
                may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with<br>
                the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General<br>
                Public License instead of this License.  But first, please read<br>

                <br>
                Version 2, June 1991<br>
                <br>
                Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
                59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA<br>
                <br>
                Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br>
                document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
                <br>
                Preamble<br>
                <br>
                The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share<br>
                and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to<br>
                guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the<br>
                software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to<br>
                most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose<br>
                authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is<br>
                covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to<br>
                your programs, too.<br>
                <br>
                When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our<br>
                General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to<br>
                distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),<br>
                that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change<br>
                the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you<br>
                can do these things.<br>
                <br>
                To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny<br>
                you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions<br>
                translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the<br>
                software, or if you modify it.<br>
                <br>
                For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for<br>
                a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must<br>
                make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must<br>
                show them these terms so they know their rights.<br>
                <br>
                We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)<br>
                offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute<br>
                and/or modify the software.<br>
                <br>
                Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that<br>
                everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the<br>
                software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to<br>
                know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced<br>
                by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.<br>
                <br>
                Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We<br>
                wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will<br>
                individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.<br>
                To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for<br>
                everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
                <br>
                The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification<br>
                follow.<br>
                <br>
                TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
                <br>
                0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice<br>
                placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of<br>
                this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program<br>
                or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any<br>
                derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the<br>
                Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or<br>
                translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included<br>
                without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as<br>
                "you".<br>
                <br>
                Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by<br>
                this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is<br>
                not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents<br>
                constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by<br>
                running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
                <br>
                1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as<br>
                you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
                appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and<br>
                disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License<br>
                and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the<br>
                Program a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
                <br>
                You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may<br>
                at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
                <br>
                2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus<br>
                forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications<br>
                or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of<br>
                these conditions:<br>
                <br>
                a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating<br>
                that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
                <br>
                b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or<br>
                in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be<br>
                licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of<br>
                this License.<br>
                <br>
                c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,<br>
                you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the<br>
                most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an<br>
                appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or<br>
                else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute<br>
                the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy<br>
                of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does<br>
                not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is<br>
                not required to print an announcement.)<br>
                <br>
                These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable<br>
                sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably<br>
                considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and<br>
                its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate<br>
                works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a<br>
                work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms<br>
                of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire<br>
                whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
                <br>
                Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your<br>
                rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the<br>
                right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on<br>
                the Program.<br>
                <br>
                In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the<br>
                Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or<br>
                distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this<br>
                License.<br>
                <br>
                3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under<br>
                Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and<br>
                2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
                <br>
                a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source<br>
                code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above<br>
                on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
                <br>
                b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to<br>
                give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically<br>
                performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the<br>
                corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1<br>
                and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
                <br>
                c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to<br>
                distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only<br>
                for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in<br>
                object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with<br>
                Subsection b above.)<br>
                <br>
                The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making<br>
                modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all<br>
                the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface<br>
                definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation<br>
                of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code<br>
                distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either<br>
                source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)<br>
                of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
                itself accompanies the executable.<br>
                <br>
                If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy<br>
                from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source<br>
                code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though<br>
                third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
                <br>
                4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as<br>
                expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,<br>
                sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate<br>
                your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or<br>
                rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so<br>
                long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br>
                <br>
                5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.<br>
                However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program<br>
                or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not<br>
                accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or<br>
                any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to<br>
                do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
                the Program or works based on it.<br>
                <br>
                6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),<br>
                the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to<br>
                copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.<br>
                You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the<br>
                rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by<br>
                third parties to this License.<br>
                <br>
                7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
                infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions<br>
                are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that<br>
                contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the<br>
                conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy<br>
                simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br>
                obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.<br>
                For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution<br>
                of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through<br>
                you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
                refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
                <br>
                If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any<br>
                particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and<br>
                the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.<br>
                <br>
                It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or<br>
                other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this<br>
                section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software<br>
                distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many<br>
                people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software<br>
                distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
                system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to<br>
                distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that<br>
                choice.<br>
                <br>
                This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a<br>
                consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
                <br>
                8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain<br>
                countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original<br>
                copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit<br>
                geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that<br>
                distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In<br>
                such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body<br>
                of this License.<br>
                <br>
                9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the<br>
                General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in<br>
                spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems<br>
                or concerns.<br>
                <br>
                Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
                specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later<br>
                version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of<br>
                that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
                If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may<br>
                choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
                <br>
                10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs<br>
                whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for<br>
                permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,<br>
                write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.<br>
                Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of<br>
                all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of<br>
                software generally.<br>
                <br>
                NO WARRANTY<br>
                <br>
                11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR<br>
                THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE<br>
                STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE<br>
                PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br>
                INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND<br>
                FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br>
                PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,<br>
                YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
                <br>
                12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL<br>
                ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE<br>
                PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
                GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
                INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA<br>
                BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A<br>
                FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER<br>
                OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
                <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
                How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs<br>
                <br>
                If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible<br>
                use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software<br>
                which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.<br>
                <br>
                To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach<br>
                them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion<br>
                of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a<br>
                pointer to where the full notice is found.<br>
                <br>
                One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.<br>
                <br>

                You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along<br>
                with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59<br>

                Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.<br>
                <br>
                If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it<br>
                starts in an interactive mode:<br>

                called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be<br>

                You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,<br>

                This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>
                proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may<br>
                consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the<br>
                library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public<br>

                "CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL<br>
                <br>
                Certain source files distributed by Oracle America and/or its affiliates are<br>
                subject to the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but<br>
                only where Oracle has expressly included in the particular source file's header<br>
                the words "Oracle designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath"<br>
                exception as provided by Oracle in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."<br>
                <br>
                Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making<br>
                a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of<br>
                the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.<br>
                <br>
                As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you<br>
                permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an<br>
                executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,<br>
                and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your<br>
                choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,<br>
                the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent<br>
                module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If<br>
                you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of<br>
                the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do<br>
                so, delete this exception statement from your version.<br></p>

                control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,<br>
                "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the<br>
                direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or<br>
                otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the<br>

                and conversions to other media types.<br>
                <br>
                "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or<br>
                Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a<br>
                copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work<br>
                (an example is provided in the Appendix below).<br>
                <br>
                "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object<br>
                form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the<br>
                editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications<br>
                represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes<br>
                of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain<br>
                separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,<br>
                the Work and Derivative Works thereof.<br>
                <br>
                "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including<br>
                the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions<br>
                to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally<br>
                submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner<br>
                or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of<br>
                the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"<br>
                means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent<br>
                to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to<br>
                communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,<br>
                and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the<br>
                Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but<br>
                excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise<br>
                designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br>
                <br>
                "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity<br>

                <br>
                2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,<br>
                publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the<br>
                Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.<br>
                <br>
                3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,<br>
                worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable<br>
                (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,<br>
                use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,<br>
                where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable<br>
                by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their<br>
                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)<br>
                with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You<br>
                institute patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
                cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work<br>
                or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct<br>
                or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses<br>
                granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate<br>
                as of the date such litigation is filed.<br>
                <br>
                4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the<br>
                Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without<br>
                modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You<br>
                meet the following conditions:<br>
                <br>
                (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or<br>
                Derivative Works a copy of this License; and<br>
                <br>
                (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
                stating that You changed the files; and<br>
                <br>
                (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works<br>
                that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and<br>
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,<br>
                excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of<br>
                the Derivative Works; and<br>
                <br>
                (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its<br>
                distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must<br>
                include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained<br>
                within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not<br>
                pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one<br>
                of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed<br>
                as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or<br>
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,<br>
                within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and<br>
                wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents<br>
                of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and<br>
                do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution<br>
                notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside<br>
                or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided<br>
                that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed<br>
                as modifying the License.<br>
                <br>
                You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and<br>
                may provide additional or different license terms and conditions<br>
                for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or<br>
                for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,<br>
                reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with<br>
                the conditions stated in this License.<br>
                <br>
                5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,<br>
                any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work<br>
                by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of<br>
                this License, without any additional terms or conditions.<br>
                Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify<br>
                the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed<br>
                with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br>
                <br>
                6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade<br>
                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,<br>
                except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the<br>
                origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br>
                <br>
                7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or<br>
                agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each<br>
                Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,<br>
                WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or<br>
                implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions<br>
                of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A<br>
                PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the<br>
                appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any<br>
                risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br>
                <br>
                8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,<br>
                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,<br>
                unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly<br>
                negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be<br>
                liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,<br>
                incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a<br>
                result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the<br>
                Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,<br>
                work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all<br>
                other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor<br>
                has been advised of the possibility of such damages.<br>
                <br>
                9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing<br>
                the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,<br>
                and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,<br>
                or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this<br>
                License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only<br>
                on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf<br>
                of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,<br>
                defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability<br>
                incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason<br>
                of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br>
                <br>
                END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
                <br>
